# c-examples
C code I have written.

The project consists of the following parts

## Libraries

Currently four libraries I have developed while writing garbage
collectors and other projects. They are located in the `libraries`
directory:

 * `datatypes` - Standard datatypes for C programming like `vector`
   and `hashset`.
 * `collectors` - An object model and a bunch of garbage collectors.
 * `quickfit` - A memory allocator based on the Quick Fit algorithm.
 * `linalg` - Trival linear algebra (3D) library.
 * `isect` - A collection of ray/triangle intersection algorithms

## Tests

Test suites for the various libraries.

## Programs

Demo programs of all kinds.

### Raytracer

A simple raytracer I built for fun.
