# c-examples
C code I have written.

The project consists of the following parts

## Libraries

Currently three libraries I have developed while writing garbage
collectors. They are located in the `libraries` directory:

 * `datatypes` - Standard datatypes for C programming like `vector`
   and `hashset`.
 * `collectors` - An object model and a bunch of garbage collectors.
 * `quickfit` - A memory allocator based on the Quick Fit algorithm.
